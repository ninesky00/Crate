### Project: Crate

Group Member Names: Joe Jiang, Kelly Dinneen, Richard Tyler, Robert Heath, Allison Dietz, Brian Forbes

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
  * Stick to the DTR
  * Set boundaries: personal and professional
  * Getting experience working with students from our complementary cohorts
  * Learning and applying rebase GIT workflow
  * Gaining experience working with a larger cross pollinated team, working with a larger legacy codebase


Schedule Expectations:
  * General Schedule weekdays/weekends: Break roughly from 4-5:30 MST. Probably wrap up around 7pm MST for Joe and Robert, and later (maybe 9 or 10pm) for those in Colorado.

Communication Expectations:
  * Daily Stand-up:
    - What do we want to accomplish?
    - What isn't making sense?
    - What needs to be revisited?
    - READ RUBRIC AGAIN!


Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
  * Paired programming when necessary, especially in regards to learning/applying new technology, or when working with someone from their complementary cohort
  * Dividing and conquering would be acceptable/useful for features/refactoring that are not new concepts


Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
  * GitHub projects.
  * GitHub issues: using labels for each Component.
  * Use a PR Template.
  * Slack: communication outside of class.
  * Zoom: Study Hall.
  * Use git rebase as called for or appropriate.
  * Use feature, testing, refactor etc. to precede the branch name. No initials necessary before feature name
  * example branch names feature/basic-css-styling, or testing/cypress-test-heading-component
  * Make sure to assign yourself to any ticket(s) you may be working on, and move them to the "in progress" column.


Pomodoro Break Schedule:
  * 30 on: 5 off

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
  * Daily stand-ups
  * Assume positive intent, acknowledge negative impact.

Additional Remote Considerations:
  * Rob and Joe are 1 hour ahead of Denver time.


Day 1 Agenda:
  * Complete this DTR
  * Familiarize yourself with the platform and code specific to your assigned track
  * Create project board with chores for environment setup, code annotations, and test additions
